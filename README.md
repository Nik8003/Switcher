## Scraping / Class definition / Weather data analysis
This is our projecy repository for the exam "Programming for data analysis". It scrapes weather data from multiple web sources and the Open Meteo API. The different pieces of information were combined into a Class definition that allows to structure a useful datatype. The weather infos were finally combined into a clean .csv file that has been extensively analysed with R to extract meaningful insights.
